--- Represents an event triggered when a new cursor is created by a SculkCatalyst. Cursor Definition: A cursor in this context is a dynamic marker or pointer generated by the SculkCatalyst. It occupies a block and spreads sculk as it moves. It is similar to entity, but it is not an entity. Cursors are ticked by the tile entity. Triggers for Cursor Creation: An entity, when killed and drops experience, within an 8-block radius of a SculkCatalyst. An explicit call from a plugin using SculkCatalyst#bloom(Block, int). The result of #getBlock() is the location that the cursor is spawning at.

--- Sets the charge of the cursor. Increasing the charge of a cursor makes the cursor last longer, giving it more time to spread sculk blocks across a larger range. Typically, charges should be set to the exp reward of a mob (EntityDeathEvent#getDroppedExp()), which is usually 3-5 for animals, and 5-10 for the average mob (up to 50 for wither skeletons). Roughly speaking, for each charge, 1 more sculk block will be placed.
